int x, y, z, w;

x = 9;
z = 5;
y = x + z;

70.Write a code segment to report which value of three integer values is the largest.  
Assume a, b, and c have been declared and hold different valid values.  
Try to make your code efficient. I only want the largest value, not all three in some order.

71. Copy and Modify the following code so that the output will always be formatted as shown.  
Do not use sequences of '.' or ' '.  
The positions of the first digit of the height, the dollar sign, and both decimal points are important.  
Assume height and income are doubles. 
You do not have to print out the number line.(12345678901234567890...)  

cout << name_str  << height << income;

12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

71.Write a program that will read in three values and a name string (in that order) from a file and report the average of the values to the screen.  
Assume the values are on the first line and the name is on the second line of the file.  The name may be multiple words.  
The values being read in are integers.  However, the average should be displayed to one decimal place.  
The output should look something like this:
I. M. Bushed had values of 120, 100 and 80 for an average of 100.0.
You may omit comments explaining the steps in the program.
